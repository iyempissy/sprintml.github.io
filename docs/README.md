# SprintML Lab Website

This repo contains the code for the SprintML Lab website.

The website is adapted from https://cleverhans-lab.github.io/ and builds on the Jekyll static website generator. 
We want to especially acknowledge [Stephan Rabanser](https://rabanser.dev/) for his great work on implementing https://cleverhans-lab.github.io/ whose features build the backbone of this website.
